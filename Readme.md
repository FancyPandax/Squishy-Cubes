Squishy Cubes




Squishy Cubes is a 2D soft-body physics simulation built in C++ using Raylib
.
It demonstrates Verlet integration, stick constraints, and shape-matching physics to create interactive, squishy cubes.

Drag, flick, and manipulate cubes with your mouse, and adjust physics parameters in real-time using on-screen sliders.
