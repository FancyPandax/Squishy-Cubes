<h1>Squishy Cubes</h1>




Squishy Cubes is a 2D soft-body physics simulation built in C++ using Raylib
.
It demonstrates *Verlet integration*, stick constraints, and shape-matching physics to create interactive, squishy cubes.

Drag, flick, and manipulate cubes with your mouse, and adjust physics parameters in real-time using on-screen sliders.

Mouse interaction:

Drag cubes

Flick cubes with velocity

Cube-cube and particle collision

Real-time sliders for physics parameters

Add/Delete cubes:

A – Add a new cube at mouse position

D – Delete cube under mouse

<h2>Controls</h2>
